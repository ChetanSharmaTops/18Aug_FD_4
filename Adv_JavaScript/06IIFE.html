    <h1>IIFE Function</h1>
    <p>
      An immediately invoked function expression, or IIFE (pronounced iffy), is
      a function that is called immediately after it is defined.
    </p>
    <p>Functions Are The Heart Of JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Functions Are Treated As First Class Citizens In JavaScript.</p>

    <script>
      (function () {
        console.log("Namaste Bharat");
      })();

      //   First parenthesis used for understanding that this is IIFE function
      // Second Parenthesis is used to call the IIFE function
    </script>
