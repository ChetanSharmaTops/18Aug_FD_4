      <mark
        >When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
        “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided
        that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would
        help. But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language
        with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation
        to Java at all.</mark
